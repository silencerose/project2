<h1>Mia Anderson's Classes</h1>

  <div class="introduction">
  
<h3>Hello readers! As the title says I am Mia Anderson, a 10th grader at Da Vinci Communcations, aspiring video game designer, freelance artist, and a soon to be memeber of the web design pathway of this school.</h3>

<p>Below you'll find a list of links leading to the different projects I'm doing for each of my classes. They're ordered by first to last and the reason there isn't one for computer science is because this website is the project.
<br>
Hope you enjoy!</p>
